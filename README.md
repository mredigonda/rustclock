## Motivation

Command line tools often require we invest a considerable amount of time into learning the different configuration options on how to use them.

While those options are great if we are using the tool in connection with some script that needs to use the program in a very specific way, it's **completely unnecessary** for human users.

RustClock was created as a means to demonstrate how much better it can be. You don't need to know anything about RustClock to start using it, just run it, as many times as you need, and it will work as a conversation with the tool in order to achieve what you want.
